The AI engineer's work on Pookie4u has focused on refining existing features and implementing new UI/UX designs. Initially, the engineer fixed an incomplete login screen, adding missing input forms and error styling. Authentication issues, particularly recurring 401 errors, were debugged and resolved by implementing robust session validation in the  and modifying the main app entry point to correctly handle authentication states. The app's visual identity underwent significant changes, including comprehensive logo integration across welcome, splash, and authentication screens, followed by multiple iterations to achieve a consistent, elegant soft pink gradient theme throughout the entire application as per user-provided reference designs. Date formatting was standardized to DD-MM-YYYY across the app. Core functionalities like displaying real-time upcoming events on the home screen and backend task completion were implemented and verified. The engineer also addressed Git repository corruption and guided the user on recovery. Currently, the authentication system has been streamlined to support only Email and Google OAuth, with other methods removed. The immediate task is to design and implement a new subscription screen based on a user-provided reference.

<product_requirements>
Pookie4u is a gamified mobile app for couples, featuring AI-powered tasks, events with notifications (including Indian festivals and custom events), curated gifts, and daily love messages. It includes email, mobile, Google, and Apple ID authentication (though only Email and Google were kept by user choice). Monetization involves a ₹79/month or ₹450/6-month subscription after a 14-day free trial. Key enhancements include relationship-mode-specific content, a sortable event list, persistent points/streaks, dark mode (not implemented yet), DD/MM/YYYY date format, haptics, editable account fields, and a single favorite food field. Event management requires edit/delete with customizable reminders. The UI prioritizes a clean, readable, user-friendly design.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with a major redesign of the sign-in/sign-up flow and the creation of a new Subscription Screen, aligning with a user-provided reference image. This involved using the P4U logo, a soft pink and white color scheme, minimal layout, rounded corners, and simple icons.

The work completed so far in this phase includes:
-   **Downloading Assets**: The new  and  were downloaded.
-   **Redesigning AuthScreen**: The  has been updated to reflect the clean, minimal design. This involved:
    -   Incorporating the new  prominently.
    -   Adding new styles to achieve the clean minimal design as per the reference image.
    -   Redesigning the sign-up section () within  to match this clean minimal aesthetic.
    -   Updating the back button styling to fit the new design.

The AI engineer has successfully redesigned the welcome, login, and signup components within  according to the new visual guidelines, preparing the groundwork for a unified aesthetic. The next logical step is to create the new Subscription Screen, which was explicitly requested as part of the same design task.
