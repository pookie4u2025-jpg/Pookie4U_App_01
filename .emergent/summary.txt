The AI engineer has significantly enhanced the Pookie4u application across several core functionalities, moving from initial bug fixes to comprehensive feature additions. Key initial tasks included resolving JSX syntax errors in , fixing streak calculation and  initialization in , ensuring profile achievements display correctly in , and refining event categorization in .

Subsequently, the engineer focused on expanding the AI task generation system in  to incorporate pre-written daily and weekly tasks for Daily Meetup (DAILY_IRL), Long Distance, and Same Home relationship modes, replacing LLM generation where applicable. This involved adding extensive task lists and corresponding retrieval logic.

Most recently, the focus shifted to implementing Google OAuth authentication, requiring both backend () and frontend (, , ) modifications, including guiding the user for credential setup. Concurrently, a robust daily messaging system was built, introducing 750 pre-written messages across various categories for each relationship mode. The backend (, ) was updated to serve these messages, and the frontend () is currently being refactored to consume and display these new, categorized messages with a 3 messages per category display logic, which required further backend adjustments to  and the  endpoint. The trajectory concludes with the frontend  being updated to display these multiple messages per category.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on integrating the new relationship-mode-specific daily messages into the frontend. The backend implementation for serving 750 pre-written messages (150 per category for Good Morning, Good Night, Love Confession, Apology, and Funny Hinglish) for Daily Meetup, Long Distance, and Same Home modes has been completed and tested (backend 100% success rate).

The  file was updated to include these message lists and a  method that retrieves 3 messages per category. The  file was updated with a new API endpoint  to expose this functionality, ensuring it now correctly requests 3 messages per category from the service.

The current work is focused on the  component in the frontend. The component is undergoing a complete rewrite to:
1.  Fetch messages from the new  endpoint.
2.  Parse and group the received messages (which are now 3 per category).
3.  Display these multiple messages per category, allowing users to choose from them.

The last action involved continuing to update the message display section in  to reflect the new data structure. The frontend is currently in a state where it expects to receive 3 messages per category from the backend and needs its rendering logic adjusted accordingly.

<optional_next_step>
Continue updating the  component to correctly display multiple messages per category.
