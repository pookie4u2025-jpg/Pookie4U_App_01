The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing the Pookie4u app's Gifts tab, implementing app-wide animations and haptics, and resolving critical infrastructure issues. Key tasks included extracting product names and unique images from Amazon affiliate links for the Gifts tab, fixing a persistent Google OAuth  error by dynamically configuring redirect URIs, and introducing subtle, permanent animations and haptic feedback across the app using  and . A significant refactor was done in  to handle React Hooks correctly within  functions. The engineer also spent considerable effort troubleshooting recurring ngrok tunnel disconnections, eventually providing a comprehensive summary of all fixes and offering guidance for Google Cloud Console configuration. The current task is a comprehensive audit of the entire application.

<product_requirements>
Pookie4u is a gamified mobile app for couples, featuring AI-powered tasks, events with notifications (including Indian festivals and custom events), curated gifts, and daily love messages. It supports Email and Google authentication, with monetization via a ₹79/month or ₹450/6-month subscription after a 14-day free trial. Desired enhancements include relationship-mode content, a sortable event list, persistent points/streaks, dark mode (not implemented), DD/MM/YYYY date format, haptics, editable account fields, a single favorite food field, and event management (edit/delete with customizable reminders). The UI prioritizes a clean, readable, user-friendly design.
Recent implementations include a new subscription screen UI, onboarding date format parsing, restored settings button on profile, formatted dates in partner profile, updated welcome screen logo, and backend integration for Razorpay and Amazon affiliate links for gifts. Explicit user requests during this trajectory were to extract *actual product names* and *unique product images* from each Amazon affiliate link for the Gifts tab, and to add subtle, permanent app-wide animations and haptics to buttons.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with a comprehensive audit of the entire Pookie4u application. This audit involves checking all features, functionality, and AI integrations. This request came after successfully addressing several critical user feedback points:
1.  **Product Images on Gifts Tab**: The Gifts tab was updated to display actual product names and images scraped from Amazon affiliate links. While unique images were extracted for the first three provided links, the remaining links (4-6), which all redirected to similar women's trousers, were assigned alternating images. This was an iteration to resolve the user's feedback that all the products still show same images.
2.  **Google Authentication Fix**: The  error encountered during Google OAuth was resolved. This involved updating  to dynamically generate the  using Expo's  based on the app's configuration, rather than using a hardcoded ngrok URL. The exact steps for updating the Google Cloud Console with the new redirect URIs were also provided to the user.
3.  **App-wide Animations and Haptics**: Subtle, permanent animations and haptic feedback were introduced across the application. This involved creating  for reusable animation logic, updating  to include haptics, and making significant modifications to  to integrate these animations and haptics, including refactoring to correctly use React Hooks.
4.  **Tunnel Stability**: Efforts were made to troubleshoot persistent ngrok tunnel disconnections, though the issue was recurring. The current working solution relies on the preview URL for testing.

The AI engineer had just begun the comprehensive audit by reviewing  and planned to inspect other key screens to fulfill the user's request for a detailed overview of the app's features and AI functionality.
