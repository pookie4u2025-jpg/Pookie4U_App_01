The AI engineer's work in the provided trajectory involved multiple feature enhancements and bug fixes for the Pookie4u app. Key tasks included designing and integrating a new subscription screen UI, fixing date parsing errors in the onboarding flow, restoring a missing settings button on the profile screen, standardizing date display in the partner profile, and updating the welcome screen logo. A significant portion of the work focused on debugging and rectifying Google OAuth authentication issues, which involved correctly configuring environment variables, updating deprecated API calls, and handling redirect URIs. Finally, Amazon affiliate links were integrated into the Gifts tab, including addressing issues with outdated backend data and irrelevant product links. The immediate next step involves updating the backend with generic product names and images for the affiliate links.

Pookie4u is a gamified mobile app for couples, featuring AI-powered tasks, events with notifications (including Indian festivals and custom events), curated gifts, and daily love messages. It supports Email and Google authentication. Monetization involves a ₹79/month or ₹450/6-month subscription after a 14-day free trial. Key enhancements include relationship-mode-specific content, a sortable event list, persistent points/streaks, dark mode (not implemented), DD/MM/YYYY date format, haptics, editable account fields, and a single favorite food field. Event management requires edit/delete with customizable reminders. The UI prioritizes a clean, readable, user-friendly design.
Recent implementations include a new subscription screen UI, onboarding date format parsing, restored settings button on profile, formatted dates in partner profile, updated welcome screen logo, and backend integration for Razorpay and Amazon affiliate links for gifts.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on integrating Amazon affiliate links into the Gifts tab. The user provided a set of affiliate links, which were added to the backend  endpoint in .

During this process, it was discovered that:
1.  There were two gift endpoints in  and an old  constant was being used, causing the app to display outdated example.com links instead of the new affiliate links.
2.  This was fixed by locating and updating the  constant and ensuring the correct endpoint was being used.
3.  Even after correcting the code, the backend sometimes returned old data, requiring a force restart of the backend service to ensure the latest changes were loaded.
4.  After these fixes, the backend was confirmed to be returning the correct Amazon affiliate links.

The user then requested to display actual product names and photos from these links, similar to the Amazon mobile app. The engineer attempted to extract this information but noted that the provided links redirected to generic women's trousers, not relevant couple gifts. The last action was to update the backend with generic product names and use a generic gift icon, based on the user's confirmation to proceed with the provided links for testing purposes.
