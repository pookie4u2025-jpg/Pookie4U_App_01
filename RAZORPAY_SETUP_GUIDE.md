## üîê Security Notes

### Test Mode vs Live Mode:

**Test Mode (Current):**
- Uses test API keys (`rzp_test_`)
- No real money transactions
- Test cards only
- Perfect for development

**Live Mode (Later):**
- Uses live API keys (`rzp_live_`)
- Real money transactions
- Requires KYC verification
- For production deployment

---

## üìä Webhook Setup (I'll Handle This)

Razorpay will send webhooks for:
- `subscription.charged` - Subscription renewed
- `subscription.cancelled` - Subscription cancelled
- `subscription.completed` - Trial ended
- `payment.failed` - Payment failed

I'll create webhook endpoints to handle these automatically.
