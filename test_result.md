# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Root cause found - FastAPI/Pydantic returns complex validation error objects in 'detail' field instead of simple string messages. When frontend tries to display these objects, they show as '[object Object]'. SPECIFIC ISSUES: 1) Invalid email format returns complex Pydantic validation object with type/loc/msg/input/ctx fields. 2) Missing required fields return complex validation arrays with multiple error objects. 3) JSON parsing errors return nested error objects. TESTING RESULTS: 9 tests run, 33.3% success rate. Success cases work fine (duplicate email returns proper string), but validation errors return complex objects. RECOMMENDATION: Backend needs custom error handler to convert Pydantic validation errors to simple string messages for frontend consumption."

SUCCESS CASES WORK: Valid registration (200) and duplicate email (400) return proper formats. FAILURE CASES: Invalid email, missing fields, malformed JSON all return complex objects.

CRITICAL BUG FIX CONFIRMED: Main agent successfully implemented custom FastAPI exception handler (lines 67-90 in server.py) that converts complex Pydantic validation errors into simple string messages. VALIDATION ERROR TESTING RESULTS: ‚úÖ Empty body returns 'Email is required; Password is required; Name is required' (simple string). ‚úÖ Missing name returns 'Name is required' (simple string). ‚úÖ Missing email returns 'Email is required' (simple string). ‚úÖ Missing password returns 'Password is required' (simple string). ‚úÖ Invalid email format returns 'Email: value is not a valid email address...' (simple string). ‚úÖ Invalid name type returns 'Name: Input should be a valid string' (simple string). ‚úÖ Multiple missing fields returns 'Email is required; Password is required' (combined simple string). ‚úÖ Malformed JSON returns '72: JSON decode error' (simple string). ‚úÖ Valid registration continues working correctly (200 status with access_token). ERROR RESPONSE FORMAT VERIFIED: All error responses now return {\"detail\": \"Simple error message string\"} with HTTP status 422 for validation errors. Frontend should now display readable error messages instead of '[object Object]'. The custom exception handler successfully resolves the user-reported bug by converting complex Pydantic validation objects to human-readable strings."

    - message: "üéØ RELATIONSHIP MODE UPDATE FUNCTIONALITY COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: Conducted exhaustive testing of the relationship mode update endpoint that was causing frontend JSON parse errors ('Unexpected character: p') with 14 comprehensive test cases achieving 92.9% success rate (13/14 tests passed). CRITICAL FINDINGS - NO HTML ERROR PAGES: ‚úÖ PUT /api/user/relationship-mode returns proper JSON responses, NOT HTML error pages. ‚úÖ All valid relationship modes (SAME_HOME, DAILY_IRL, LONG_DISTANCE) working perfectly with proper JSON responses and task regeneration. ‚úÖ Authentication properly required (403 JSON response for missing auth, 401 JSON response for invalid tokens). ‚úÖ Response format analysis confirmed: All endpoints return proper JSON with correct Content-Type headers, no HTML tags detected in responses. ‚úÖ Task regeneration working perfectly - mode changes trigger automatic task regeneration with correct task counts. ‚úÖ Database persistence verified - relationship mode changes properly saved and retrievable via profile endpoint. ROOT CAUSE OF FRONTEND ERROR IDENTIFIED: The 'Unexpected character: p' error is NOT caused by the backend returning HTML instead of JSON. Backend is functioning correctly with proper JSON responses. The issue is likely in the frontend JavaScript/React code parsing or handling the JSON response. MINOR BACKEND ISSUE FOUND: RelationshipMode model accepts invalid mode values (should validate against SAME_HOME/DAILY_IRL/LONG_DISTANCE only). However, this doesn't cause HTML responses - it still returns proper JSON. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent should investigate frontend code that handles the relationship mode update response, particularly JSON parsing logic and error handling in the account settings component. Backend API is production-ready and working correctly."

DAILY ROTATION IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESS: ‚úÖ Each day now shows different 3 messages per category (not monthly) - VERIFIED. ‚úÖ 15 messages per day (3 messages √ó 5 categories = 15 messages daily) - VERIFIED. ‚úÖ 450 messages per month (15 messages √ó 30 days = 450 messages monthly rotation) - VERIFIED. ‚úÖ Daily uniqueness confirmed - each day shows different messages from the 450-message pool. COMPREHENSIVE DAILY ROTATION TESTING RESULTS: ‚úÖ Daily Messages API Testing: All 3 relationship modes (SAME_HOME, DAILY_IRL, LONG_DISTANCE) return exactly 15 messages with perfect distribution (3 messages per category across 5 categories). ‚úÖ Daily Rotation Verification: Metadata confirms rotation_type='daily' (not monthly), day_of_year and rotation_day metadata fields present, messages_per_day=15 and total_messages_per_month=450 correctly set. ‚úÖ Message Pool Verification: System uses all 90 messages per category (450 total per relationship mode), daily rotation cycles through different messages each day, message indices within 0-89 range for 90-message pool, rotation_day within 30-day cycle (0-29). ‚úÖ Daily Uniqueness: Same day returns consistent messages (deterministic based on date), consecutive API calls return identical messages ensuring user experience consistency. ‚úÖ Cross-Relationship Mode Testing: All 3 relationship modes return exactly 15 messages, each mode has proper daily rotation independent of others, different relationship modes have different message sets as expected. ‚úÖ API Response Structure: Each message has complete structure (id, text, category, relationship_mode, generated_at, metadata), metadata includes rotation_type='daily', day_of_year, rotation_day, category_index, message_index, messages_per_category=3, messages_per_day=15, total_messages_per_month=450. ‚úÖ Error Handling: Invalid relationship modes correctly return 400 errors. CRITICAL SUCCESS: The system now uses 30-day cycle (rotation_day 0-29) then repeats, providing daily rotation within the 450-message pool per relationship mode. Minor Issue: Empty string relationship mode returns 307 redirect instead of 400 error (edge case). DAILY MESSAGE ROTATION SYSTEM IS PRODUCTION-READY: Successfully updated from monthly to daily rotation, exceeds all user requirements with perfect functionality, provides 450 unique messages per month per relationship mode with daily variation, maintains deterministic behavior for consistent user experience."

    - message: "üö® CRITICAL REGISTRATION ENDPOINT BUG IDENTIFIED - '[object Object]' ERROR ROOT CAUSE FOUND: Conducted comprehensive testing of the registration endpoint to investigate user-reported '[object Object]' error when creating new accounts. TESTING RESULTS: 9 registration tests conducted with 33.3% success rate (3/9 passed). SUCCESS CASES WORKING: Valid registration returns proper JSON with access_token and token_type=bearer. Duplicate email properly returns 400 status with simple string error message 'Email already registered'. CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: FastAPI/Pydantic validation errors return complex nested objects instead of simple string messages, causing '[object Object]' display in frontend. SPECIFIC PROBLEMS: 1) Invalid email format returns complex validation object: {'type': 'value_error', 'loc': ['body', 'email'], 'msg': '...', 'input': '...', 'ctx': {...}}. 2) Missing required fields return validation arrays: [{'type': 'missing', 'loc': ['body', 'name'], 'msg': 'Field required', 'input': {...}, 'url': '...'}]. 3) JSON parsing errors return nested error objects with detail arrays. ROOT CAUSE: When frontend JavaScript tries to display these complex objects as strings, they show as '[object Object]' because JavaScript cannot convert complex objects to readable strings automatically. SOLUTION NEEDED: Backend requires custom FastAPI exception handler to convert Pydantic ValidationError objects to simple string messages in 'detail' field. EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMATIC RESPONSES: Invalid email: {'detail': [{'type': 'value_error', 'loc': ['body', 'email'], 'msg': 'value is not a valid email address: An email address must have an @-sign.', 'input': 'invalid-email', 'ctx': {'reason': 'An email address must have an @-sign.'}}]}. Missing name: {'detail': [{'type': 'missing', 'loc': ['body', 'name'], 'msg': 'Field required', 'input': {'email': 'test@example.com', 'password': 'pass123'}, 'url': 'https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/missing'}]}. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent should implement custom FastAPI validation exception handler to extract 'msg' field from Pydantic errors and return simple string messages instead of complex objects."
